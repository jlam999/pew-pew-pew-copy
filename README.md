# Pew Pew Pew Website GitHub Repository

Hi! This is our website for Weblab 2023. We decided to make a shooter game with a small twist: every time a player shoots bullets, their health decreases! Players must not waste too many bullets or else they might find themselves vulnerable to attack! Don't worry, you can still recover health from collecting bullets that you miss.

Here are some cool features of our website:
- Google Authentication System
- Moving background on Home Page
- Private Rooms with Room Codes
- Handles up to 4 players per game
- How To Play Sidebar with video demonstrations
- Stats Tracking (Games played, Wins, Kills)
- Smooth player and bullet movement!
- Use your mouse to aim and shoot!
- Press the space bar to pull your bullets back!
- Grab the powerups to recharge your health!

We hope you enjoy!
