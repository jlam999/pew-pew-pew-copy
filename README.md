# Pew Pew Pew Website GitHub Repository

Hi! This is our website for Weblab 2023. We decided to make a shooter game with a small twist: every time a player shoots bullets, their health decreases! Players must not waste too many bullets or else they might find themselves vulnerable to attack! Don't worry, you can still recover health from collecting bullets that you miss.

Here are some cool features of our website:
- Google Authentication System
- Private Rooms with Room Codes
- Handles up to 4 players per game
- Stats Tracking (Games played, Wins, Kills)
- Smooth player and bullet movement
- Press the space bar to pull your bullets back!

We hope you enjoy!
